	"description": "A placeable that \"collects\" nearby decoration placeables and combines them into one.\nAllow packing and unpacking of placeables on-the fly.\n\nImproves server performance by reducing the number of individual placeable actors.\nImproves client performance by using instanced static meshes for drawing.\n\nThis is supposed to work with any STATIC decoration item, however it uses a whitelist for now.\n\nDoes (currently) NOT support:\n- skeletal meshes (like most flags)\n- most stuff with specific interactions like doors, hatches, torches, instruments, traps etc.\n- particles, lights etc.\n\nComes with prepared item lists for:\n- Conan Exiles + DLCs\n- Age of Calamitous\n- Ancient Civilization\n- Deco and Placeables\n- Desert Town\n- Dudes Delightful Decorations\n- Emberlight\n- ExilesExtreme\n- GCam\n- LdS-Modpack\n- NothernTimber\n- SavageSteel I & II\n- Shadows of Skelos Extended & II\n- ThrallWars DungeonMod\n- Warrior Mutator\n\nDiscord @ https://discord.gg/a8hGAKW",
	"changeNote": "2021-03-19 - v0.1.12\n- increased hitpoints and made the collector indestructable.\n- added tag to prevent Pickup+ from picking up the collector prematurely.\n- added over 700+ new items to the whitelist. (Conan Exiles + DLCs, SvSE, SvS2)\n- removed modified materials again. (more trouble than gain)\n",
